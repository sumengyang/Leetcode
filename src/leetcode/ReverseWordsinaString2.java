/* Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
 * For example,
 * Given s = "the sky is blue",
 * return "blue is sky the".
 * Clarification:
 * What constitutes a word?
 * A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
 * Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
 * Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
 * How about multiple spaces between two words?
 * Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
 * One simple approach is a two-pass solution: First pass to split the string by spaces into an array of words, then second pass to extract the words in reversed order.
 * We can do better in one-pass. While iterating the string in reverse order, we keep track of a wordâ€™s begin and end position. When we are at the beginning of a word, we append it.
